   "... Some ctype macros are valid only for character codes that
   isascii says are ASCII (SGI's IRIX-4.0.5 is one such system --when
   using /bin/cc or gcc but without giving an ansi option).  So, all
   ctype uses should be through macros like ISPRINT...  If
   STDC_HEADERS is defined, then autoconf has verified that the ctype
   macros don't need to be guarded with references to isascii. ...
   Defining isascii to 1 should let any compiler worth its salt
   eliminate the && through constant folding."
   Solaris defines some of these symbols so we must undefine them first. */
