## [Version 1.0](https://github.com/aureliojargas/sedsed/releases/tag/v1.0) released in 2004-12-09

- Portable: Huge changes to make the debug file portable, so now it
  works even in old UNIX versions of sed.
  (thanks Gudermez for requesting)
  (thanks Laurent Voguel for his excellent sedcheck tool)

- Better debug: The debug command to show the current sed command was
  simplified from `s///;P;s///` to a single `i` command, reducing the
  debug file size and increasing execution speed.
  (thanks Thobias Salazar Trevisan for the idea)

- Generated debug file more readable, with indented debug commands.

- Default indent prefix for `--indent` has changed from 2 to 4 spaces.

- Now the system's sed path is configurable.

- Added `--dump-debug` option to inspect the generated debug file
  (implies `--nocolor` and `--debug`).

- Bugfix: Now parses `a`, `c`, `i` commands with `;` on the text
  (thanks Leo Mulders for reporting)
